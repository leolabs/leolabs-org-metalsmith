[![Iyengar yoga in Düsseldorf](/uploads/2013/11/yoga-banner1.jpg)](/uploads/2013/11/yoga-banner1.jpg) This week, I finished the new website for Antje Keyenburg who does yoga curses in Düsseldorf. The site is in German, but if you like to, check it out: [Raum für Yoga - Iyengar Yoga in Düsseldorf](http://www.iyengar-hatha-yoga.de/) The site's design uses the theme Twenty Twelve from WordPress as a base template and is changed to match Antje's logo and newsletters which already existed.
