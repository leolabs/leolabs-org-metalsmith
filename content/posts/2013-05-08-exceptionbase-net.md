[![blog-banner](/uploads/2013/05/blog-banner.jpg)](/uploads/2013/05/blog-banner.jpg) In the last few months I've been working on a new project called ExceptionBase.NET which allows .NET developers to track exceptions that occur in their published applications. These exceptions will be submitted to a database where they can be managed, grouped, and fixed. For those interested in such a solution, I created an introduction video:

ExceptionBase.NET is completely free and open-source and you can install the web interface on your own server. That way, you don't have to worry about where your data is saved. The web interface is simple, well-arranged and built on top of Twitter's Bootstrap framework which makes it responsive, so it will look great on any browser.
