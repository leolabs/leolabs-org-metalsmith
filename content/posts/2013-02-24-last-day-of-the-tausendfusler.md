Today is the last day that we can visit the "Tausendfüßler", a bridge in Düsseldorf, Germany. Tomorrow, it will be demolished and then be replaced by a park for passengers. I've been on the bridge as it was open to passengers today and these are some of the photos I took there. These photos don't have any particular order. A video of today will be online soon and I'll add it to my Videos section when it's done. [nggallery id=8]
