[![firework-banner](/uploads/2013/06/firework-banner.jpg)](/uploads/2013/06/firework-banner.jpg) Every year, in march there's a big firework in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany on Japan's day that's organized by Japanese people - the Japanese Firework. They're always putting a lot of work into it and it's always an awesome experience to be at the firework yourself. Last year, I started taking [some pictures](http://leolabs.org/blog/pictures/japanisches-feuerwerk-2012/ "Japanisches Feuerwerk 2012") using my Canon EOS 600D, this year, I got a Canon EOS 5D Mk3 from a friend to take the pictures. Just sit back and enjoy the pictures I took :) [nggallery id=10]
